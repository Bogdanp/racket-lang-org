@abstract{

This talk is a tale of three ecosystems. Racket is finely tuned for creating novel programming
languages. Likewise, React is tuned for creating novel user interfaces, and Unreal is tuned for
creating novel 3D worlds and games. CodeSpells is a platform built atop all three, allowing for
seamless communication between each of these three runtimes.
Why? We'll demonstrate through visually compelling examples how we are using CodeSpells to
create educational technologies, novel programming interfaces, and immersive 3D games. We
hope that you'll leave this talk knowing how you too can benefit from our open-source tools and
examples.

#:more
@abstract{

dplyr, a data manipulation library for the R programming language created by Hadley Wickham, is a popular way of managing tabular data for data analysis purposes. By speaking the consistent language of tidy data, dplyr is able to achieve high levels of ergonomics, and manage complex data analysis tasks in a compositional, functional style.

@br{}

We present a new Racket library, Sawzall, inspired heavily by dplyr and the relational algebra. Sawzall builds on top of Alex Harsanyi's data-frame package, but provides a set of operations that are designed to compose and avoid mutating the original data-set, leading to a natural style of data manipulation following the idea of "do this, then that". We demonstrate the approach, implementation, and results, with a wide range of example data science tasks.

@bio{Hazel Levine (they/them) is a second-year undergraduate at Indiana University, studying computer science (with a specialization in programming languages) and theoretical mathematics. They are particularly interested in language design and ergonomics, aiming to create tools bridging the gap between concepts typically left in academia and the everyday programmer.}

@talk{Qi: A Functional, Flow-Oriented DSL}
#:more
@abstract{

One way to think about a function is as a disjointed logical sequence, which we can depict as a flowchart. This is the usual model we employ when writing functions in a typical programming language (or even an atypical one like Racket), where the absence of constraints gives us a lot of flexibility but also the ability to shoot ourselves in the foot by doing something silly.
@br{}
Another way of thinking about a function is as a flow of energy, more like an electrical circuit. This model, enabled by the Qi DSL, allows us to phrase computations in terms of flows which are simply functional building blocks with an arbitrary number of inputs and outputs that can be composed in series and in parallel to yield other flows. With such flows, we can express many common patterns more economically and more clearly than in the usual ways, eliminating repetition and boilerplate, and deriving all of the power of the functional paradigm.

@bio{As the shadowy lurker in the ramparts of Drym.org, Sid is indeed, as many have suspected, none other than the whispered-about-in-hushed-tones "Count Vajhula," vampirous author of Racket and Emacs packages. When not writing code, Sid spends his time working on fundamental solutions to social and existential problems, all of which he believes can be addressed by transitioning from an economic system based on supply and demand, to an economic system based on attribution, which would preserve and nurture our humanity, rather than feed off of and seep it as capitalism does. Struggling to bring attention to these ideas, Sid came to Racket hoping to write tangible prototypes to demonstrate the promise of these proposals. He's authored a few packages along the way, including the cli language for writing command line interfaces and the relation package for type-generic relations and operators.}

@abstract{

GNU Mes helps one reproduce an exact operating system in terms of auditable binaries. Mes integrates with Guile such that GNU Guix may leverage these benefits. By integrating Mes with Racket, we can boot directly to a Rash shell on a fresh installation. In this system, the full power of a trusted Racket installation is omnipresent and available immediately after login. Sage explains what he has done to reach this goal, and shows what remains to be done.

His contributions to Racket include aiding its relicensing effort, publishing twenty-one packages released under generous licenses, and researching alternative programming practices.

#:more
@abstract{

Resyntax is a tool that wields the power of Racketâs macro expander to analyze Racket code and suggest improvements. It uses a domain-specific language to specify refactoring rules in terms of syntax-parse macros. Rules explain why theyâre improvements, allowing Resyntax to teach users how to make their code more straightforward, more readable, and more efficient. This talk covers how Resyntax works, why itâs different from tools like code formatters and linters, and what it means for the future of Racketâs static analysis ecosystem.

S-expressions impose a uniform grouping discipline on syntax that makes them easy to parse and manipulate.
They are also flexible for adding new syntactic forms to a language.
Languages, like C, JavaScript, Haskell, and Python, have a variety of different rules for grouping and parsing syntax.
These rules can produce beautiful and information dense syntax.
They can also be hard to comprehend and internalize, as well as rigid and difficult to customize for particular programs.
C-expressions are an attempt to get the beauty and information density of C-like languages, without sacrificing comprehension and flexibilty.
L-expressions have the same goal, but try to follow the model of Python & Haskell.

Shrubbery notation is similar to S-expression notation, but instead of
generating fully formed trees, it is intended to partially group input
for further enforestation by another parser (e.g., as in Honu). The
notation is line- and indentation-sensitive, and the parsed form of a
shrubbery imposes grouping to ensure that further parsing is consistent
with the shrubbery's lines and indentation.
