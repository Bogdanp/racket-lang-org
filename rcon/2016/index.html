It extends Racket with a few constructs that make it easy to build advanced tools for program verification and synthesis. Building these tools usually takes months or years of work, as well as expertise in many fields, from formal methods to programming languages to software engineering. With Rosette, creating such a tool is as easy as defining a new domain-specific language in Racket. Once you define your language, you get the tools for (almost) free. This talk will provide a brief introduction to Rosette, concluding with a whirlwind tour of recent applications to finding bugs in radiotherapy software, generating efficent code for ultra low-power hardware, and creating custom tutors for K-12 algebra.</p><div class="bio"><a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~emina/index.html">Emina Torlak</a>  is an assistant professor at the University of Washington.

The most ambitious of these is a book about making domain-specific languages with Racket, called <a href="http://beautifulracket.com">Beautiful Racket</a>. Why a book? Because making my own DSL with Racket—<a href="http://pollenpub.com/">Pollen</a>—has improved my life tremendously. I want others to share the joy. To do that, however, I’ve had to forget what I already knew about making DSLs, and confront a few rough edges within Racket’s <tt>#lang</tt>-making apparatus. Of course, I’m a better person for it. Soon, you will be too: a summary of what I’ve discovered so far, and questions for further study.</p><div class="bio"><a href="http://pollenpub.com/">Matthew Butterick</a>: I’m a writer and designer in Los Angeles.

One member of our team developed a new method for applying WP methods to software, and has used it successfully to find nearly intractable bugs in operating systems and other software. We’re automating the method and incorporating the new Micron Automata Process to make it possible to apply our approach to million-line programs. To prove the concept, we have implemented the method in Racket, using Syntax as the intermediate language before conversion to Dijkstra Guarded Commands, and using the Syntax Browser to examine and debug the multiple representations used to convert a programming language into mathematical logic.</p><div class="bio"><a href="https://twitter.com/daviesaz">Byron Davies</a> has been programming in Lisp for 42 years, at Caltech, MIT, Stanford, Texas Instruments, Motorola, and a host of start-ups. He took up Racket two years ago—and couldn’t be happier about his choice.

This talk presents a Racket library for adding syntax warnings and suggesting refactors via the macro system. True to Racket’s philosophy, library users can define their own warnings with equal power to built in suggestions. Next time you argue over style guide rules, resolve it with a new syntax warning so it never comes up again!</p><div class="bio"><a href="http://codepen.io/Universalist/">Jack Firth</a> is a software engineer at Google, working on backend systems in Google Cloud.

Ideally, it could be more than a platform, but a greenhouse—a perfect tool for incubating new languages and growing mature ones (general purpose or domain specific). This talk presents a survey of Racket’s tools for building languages, the process it takes to add an entirely new, fully-integrated language to the ecosystem, and the places where that process could be streamlined to achieve the dream of designing, implementing, and applying an entirely new programming language in a single afternoon.</p><div class="bio"><a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/">Alexis King</a> works at CJ Affiliate writing primarily Haskell and JavaScript building web applications, APIs, and internal infrastructure.
