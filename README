  the whole site or sub-sites

To build:
=========

 [See "upload" and `--dry-run` for an alternative]

* Run "racket all.rkt -o <dir>" to build all pages to subdirectories of
  <dir>. As a safety measure, the target directory must not overlap
  with any installed directory. (Use `-f' in scripts to avoid
  answering the question about deleting existing files.)

* Running any "*.rkt" might build a page and things that it
  references. (Use `-h` as usual.) That's less true for newer pages.

* For older pages, you can choose `-w` (the default) for web mode,
  `-l` for local using "file://" references, or `-r` for' local mode
  using relative references. Normally, you'll want to use `-l` for
  testing, and then use `-w` for deployment.

* Set the $GIT_DIR environment variable to point to the ".git"
  directory of a Racket repository if you want to extract release
  information from a repository other than the enclosing one.

To upload:
==========

* You'll need credentials to upload to S3, and those credentials
  should be in "~/.aws-keys".

* You'll need the "s3-sync" Racket package installed.

* Run the "sync.rkt" script: racket -l- racket-lang-org/sync

* To build without uploading, use `--save-temps --render-locally <directory-name>`. If you
  don't have AWS credentials, the pages will still build, and look for
  "Files so far written to" for the temporary directory that contains
  the rendered pages.
