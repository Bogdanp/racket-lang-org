2025-05-15: This directory contains code that generates release notes in both textual
styles (for use in the announcements/ directory) and in a markdown style (for use in the
blog/ directory). It's currently very ad-hoc, and not directly linked to the locations
in the tree where the resulting release notes are actually used. However, putting
it here seems like a nice way to make this into shared public code. -- JBC
