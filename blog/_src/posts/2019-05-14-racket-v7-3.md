Racket version 7.3 is now available from [https://racket-lang.org/](https://racket-lang.org/)

Racket-on-Chez continues to improve. Snapshot builds are currently
available at pre.racket-lang.org, and we expect that Racket-on-Chez
will be included as a download option in the next release.

In addition, the Racket 7.3 release includes the following improvements:

* There is a new set of teaching languages for the upcoming
  German-language textbook "Schreibe Dein Programm!"
  (https://www.deinprogramm.de/).

* Racket's IO system has been refactored to improve performance
 and simplify internal design.

* Racket's JSON reader is dramatically faster.

* The `plot` library includes color map support for renderers.

* The Racket web library has improved support for 307 redirects.

* The Racket web server provides better response messages by default
 for common status codes.

* The `pict` library includes a `shear` function.
