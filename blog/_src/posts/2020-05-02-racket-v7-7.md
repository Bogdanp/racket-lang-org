Racket version 7.7 is now available from [https://racket-lang.org/](https://racket-lang.org/).

* Racket CS remains ready for production use---thanks to those who have
  been putting it into practice to help iron out the remaining
  kinks---and it now supports a C API for embedding into other
  applications. See the ["Inside: Racket"](https://docs.racket-lang.org/inside/index.html?q=inside%20racket)
  documentation for details.

* Racket CS uses a new HAMT implementation, dramatically reducing the memory
  required for immutable hash tables.

* Optimizations to the Racket CS compiler result in a code size savings
  of approximately 20%.

* GC callbacks are reliably called on major collections in Racket CS.
  Also, garbage collection is 10-20% faster.

* DrRacket can recover much more quickly from errors involving large
  stack traces.

* DrRacket now supports the use of the keyboard in the macOS Catalina
  "Open File" dialog.

* The [net/http-client collection](https://docs.racket-lang.org/net/http-client.html?q=net%2Fhttp-client)
  supports the `deflate` content encoding.

* The `call-in-continuation` function (like Marc Feeley's
  `continuation-graft`) simplifies certain `call/cc` patterns by
  calling a thunk in a restored continuation.

* The `call-with-current-language` form allows more reliable tests for language
  level code.

* Use of the Cairo library can be multi-threaded.

* Improved documentation!

* Many bug fixes!
