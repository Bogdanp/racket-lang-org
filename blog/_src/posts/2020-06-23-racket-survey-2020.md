We're taking a [survey]! We want to better understand the Racket
community, from people who have been contributing for decades to those
who have just joined us, and from seasoned programmers to those just
starting out.

One of our goals is to help bring in new contributors and make it
easier to become a part of the community.

Fill out the survey here: [https://forms.gle/XeHdgv8R7o2VjBbF9](https://forms.gle/XeHdgv8R7o2VjBbF9)

<!-- more -->

Completing the survey should take 10-15 minutes, and is anonymous
(unless you decide to include your name). The survey will be open
until July 31 and we will report on the results sometime after that.

Please help us spread the word by sharing the survey link on your
social network feeds, at conferences, around your office, and in other
communities.

If you have any questions, please let us know at
[survey@racket-lang.org](mailto:survey@racket-lang.org).
