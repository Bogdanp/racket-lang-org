----------------------------------------------------------------------

We are pleased to announce Racket v8.15 is now available from [https://download.racket-lang.org/](https://download.racket-lang.org).

## As of this release:

- Documentation search results are ordered, with visual cues
  indicating what their source is (core, main-distribution, etc.).
  These results are also grouped by language family (Racket, Rhombus,
  etc.). (See https://docs.racket-lang.org/search/index.html?q=second
  .)

- DrRacket offers to restore previously open files when starting,
  which can be made the default.

- In DrRacket, Picts can be saved by right-clicking.

- `raco pkg` introduces the `uninstall` command as the opposite of
  `install`. The `remove` name for this functionality is retained for
  compatibility. (See
  https://docs.racket-lang.org/pkg/cmdline.html#%28part._raco-pkg-uninstall%29
  .)

- `raco pkg` improves the handling of `--clone` and `--unclone`. (See
  https://docs.racket-lang.org/pkg/cmdline.html#%28part._raco-pkg-update%29
  .)

- iOS is a compilation target, distinct from macOS.

- Racket supports falling back to IPv4 during hostname resolution when
  IPv6 fails.

- Memory allocated using the ffi/unsafe library can be initially
  zeroed, using the `'zeroed-atomic` and `'zeroed-atomic-interior`
  flags. (See
  https://docs.racket-lang.org/foreign/foreign_pointer-funcs.html#%28idx._%28gentag._11._%28lib._scribblings%2Fforeign%2Fforeign..scrbl%29%29%29
  .)

- Many other bugs are fixed and documentation has been improved!
