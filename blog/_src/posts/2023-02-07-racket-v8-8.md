Racket version 8.8 is now available from
[https://download.racket-lang.org/](https://download.racket-lang.org/)

As of this release:

* The dependent contract form, `->i`, supports a #:param element that
  specifies dependencies for parameter values that are set during the
  dynamic extent of the function call.
  (See: [https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/function-contracts.html#%28form._%28%28lib._racket%2Fcontract%2Fbase..rkt%29._-~3ei%29%29](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/function-contracts.html#%28form._%28%28lib._racket%2Fcontract%2Fbase..rkt%29._-~3ei%29%29) )

* The `copy-file` library function supports permission-management
  arguments.
  (See: [https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/Filesystem.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Fprivate%2Fbase..rkt%29._copy-file%29%29](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/Filesystem.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Fprivate%2Fbase..rkt%29._copy-file%29%29) )

* Pressing \<SHIFT\>-return in DrRacket's interactions window makes
  it easier to edit and enter expressions without sending them
  to be evaluated.

* The numeric comparison operators (<, >=, etc.) require at least
  two arguments in the "How To Design Programs" teaching languages.

* Redex has improved typesetting when customized renders are used
  in certain multi-line situations.

* We have fixed many bugs, and written lots of documentation.
