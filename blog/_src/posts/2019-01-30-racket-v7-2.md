Racket version 7.2 is now available from [http://racket-lang.org/](http://racket-lang.org/)

Racket-on-Chez is done in a useful sense, but we'll wait until it gets
better before making it the default Racket implementation. For more
information, see [http://blog.racket-lang.org/2019/01/racket-on-chez-status.html](http://blog.racket-lang.org/2019/01/racket-on-chez-status.html)

In addition, the Racket 7.2 release includes the following improvements,
which apply to both implementations:

* The contract system supports collapsible contracts, which avoid
  repeated wrappers in certain pathological situations. Thanks to Daniel
  Feltey.

* Quickscript, a scripting tool for DrRacket, has become part of the
  standard distribution. Thanks to Laurent Orseau.

* The web server's built-in configuration for serving static files
  recognizes the ".mjs" extension for JavaScript modules.

* The `data/enumerate` library supports an additional form of
  subtraction via `but-not/e`, following Yorgey and Foner's ICFP'18
  paper. Thanks to Max New.

* The `letrec.rkt` example model in Redex has been changed to more
  closely match Racket, which led to some bug fixes in Racket's
  implementation of `letrec` and `set!`.

* The racklog library has seen a number of improvements, including fixes
  to logic variable binding, logic variables containing predicates being
  applicable, and the introduction of an `%andmap` higher-order predicate.
