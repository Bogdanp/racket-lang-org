Racket v8.4

Racket version 8.4 is now available from

    https://racket-lang.org/


* Command-line Racket provides a new expression editor by default for
  its read-eval-print loop (REPL). The new REPL is based on the Chez
  Scheme expression editor, but extended to use the same
  language-sensitive syntax coloring and indentation tools as DrRacket.

* Typed Racket adds a kind system, preventing programmers from
  writing nonsensical type expressions. It checks whether type
  constructors are correctly applied to arguments, and separates
  type constructors from polymorphic types. The `:kind` form enables
  checking the kind of a type expression at the REPL. The new system
  also correctly rejects some ill-formed recursive types.

* Racket has a `file-or-directory-stat` for unified information about
  file-system objects.

* DrRacket shows the region affected by an `#;` S-expression comment
  by fading the commented-out region.

* Racket on Chez has faster multiplication and division for some
  numbers.

* Web server: The files dispatcher supports all standard caching-related
  HTTP response headers (e.g., Cache-Control).

* Web server: A new dispatcher captures the common pattern of processing
  HTTP requests and responses in a layered fashion.

* The Web Server supports use of the Cache-Control header, and includes
  a new wrapping dispatcher.

* Expander: add "portal" syntax to support new forms of syntax object
  binding.

* Documentation search is improved.

* Some hash operations support an optional `try-order?` argument.

* The plot-metrics interface has documentation.

* Fonts support OpenType feature settings.

* The Gui library has improved support for Wayland.

* The computation of quadratic roots is further improved.

* The `set/c` contract adds support for random generation.

* DrRacket's interactions window supports #lang-specific coloring
  and indentation.

* DrRacket's parenthesis-based keyboard shortcuts change based on
  the parentheses that each different #lang uses.

* The release includes many other bug repairs and other improvements!

Transition/Update notes:

* To turn off expeditor and make Racket's REPL go back to the old
  editline/readline-based editor, use the command

    ,input readline

  and then restart Racket. Get back to the new expression editor with

    ,input expeditor

  To toggle color mode for the new expression editor, use one of the
  following, which does not require restarting Racket:

    ,color #false
    ,color #true

* Support for comment fading in DrRacket requires an increment to
  the "WXME" format version so files with non-text content written
  by DrRacket v8.4 will open only in v8.4 and later. This does not
  affect files that consist only of unicode text.

* The addition of the kind system to Typed Racket means that certain
  mild abuses of the type system no longer type check, most notably
  the 'application` of a polymorphic type.
