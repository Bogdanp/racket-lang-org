Racket version 6.8 is now available from

    http://racket-lang.org/

- Racket sports a new logo, courtesy of Matthew Butterick.

- MacBook Pro laptops with touch bars are supported.

- Support for FreeBSD on PowerPC.

- Initial support for GTK3 on Wayland is available. GL contexts, GC
  blits, and dialog placement currently do not work.

- The macro stepper provides a command-line interface via the
  `raco macro-stepper` command.

- Typed Racket more efficiently represents and computes types and
  propositions, resulting in faster type checking for many programs.
  For more details, see this blog post by Andrew Kent:

- The bytecode optimizer can reduce more expressions of the form
  `(equal? x y)` to `(eqv? x y)` or `(eq? x y)` when the type of `x` or
  `y` is known.

- The bytecode optimizer avoids dropping stack frames in some reductions.
  This provides better stack traces for errors when errotrace is enabled.

- The bytecode compiler detects more optimization opportunities,
  including when variables always hold a boolean value. In particular in
  expressions like (or (symbol? x) (something)), the optimizations
  avoid the creation of an intermediate variable to store the result of
  (symbol? x).

- The `syntax` form preserves syntax properties on all template pieces.

- The `scribble/html/extra` module provides renderers for HTML elements
  that are part of the WHATWG HTML standard but not part of the `scribble/html`
  `scribble/html` language by default (e.g., `map`, `time`, `video`).

- The DeinProgramm teaching languages support pattern matching using the
  `match` form.

- In the DeinProgramm languages, `define-record-procedures` supports
  specifying signatures as part of the form, instantly enabling
  properties quantifying over such records.
