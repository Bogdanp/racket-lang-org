Racket v8.16

----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Racket has expanded support for immutable and mutable treelists:
  - A variety of new treelist utility functions are available:
    `treelist-filter`, `treelist-flatten`, et cetera.
  - The `mutable-treelist-prepend!` function allows prepending to
    mutable treelists.
  - Mutable treelists are serializable.
- The `serialize-structs` module allows the minimization of
  dependencies by providing only a handful of core forms.
- The `flbit-field` function allows access to the binary
  representation of IEEE floating-point numbers.
- The top-left search box in the documentation works once more.
- The XML reader is 2-3x faster on inputs with long CDATA and
  comments, and avoids some internal contract checks to obtain a 25%
  speedup on large documents generally.
- The pregexp syntax includes "\X" to match a grapheme cluster),
  following Perl and PCRE.
- The `read-json*` and `write-json*` functions allow customization of
  the Racket representation of JSON elements, eliminating the need for
  a separate "translation" pass.
- Racket has new port I/O functions:
  - The `open-input-nowhere` function creates an empty input port.
  - The `pipe-port?` function makes it possible to determine whether a
    port is created by `make-pipe`.
  - The `port-file-stat` function allows gathering information about the
    file that is the source or target of a file-stream port.
- A revised representation of pointers improves the performance of
  foreign function calls. As a result, `ptr-ref` and `ptr-set!` are
  substantially faster.
- In anticipation of the fifteenth RacketCon, the `fifteenth` function
  returns the fifteenth element of a list.
- Racket has an improved multi-line convention for error messages.
- The `db` library allows `prepare` on virtual statements.
- The `student-t` distribution is part of the `math/distributions`
  library.
- Expeditor supports customizing the prompt, using the `#:prompt`
  keyword argument to `call-with-expeditor`.
- There is a guide to adding internationalization for a new (human)
  language.
- Optimizations to racket/profile improve asymptotic speed for very
  large call graphs.
- The `#lang htdp/asl` language incorporates Graphical Debugger
  support.
- There is lots of new documentation, and many defects repaired!
