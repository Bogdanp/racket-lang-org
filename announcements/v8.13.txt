Racket v8.13


----------------------------------------------------------------------

As of this release:

- The racket/treelist and racket/mutable-treelist libraries provide
  list-like containers that support many operations in effectively
  constant time, including appending and extracting sub-lists without
  mutating the given list. Treelists are implemented as RRB Vectors,
  invented by Stucki, Riompf, Ureche, and Bagwell.

- The `hash-filter-keys` and `hash-filter-values` functions allow users
  to filter hashes using a predicate on either keys or values.

- The `vector-extend` and `vector*-extend` functions provide a way
  to pre-populate the prefix of a newly allocated vector using the elements
  of an existing vector.

- Command-line raco setup, package update, and package installation use
  terminal control (when available) to show what they are working on
  more compactly and with a progress bar.

- Racket v8.13 uses Unicode 15.1 for character and string operations.

- Machine-specific cross-module optimization allows improved support for
  static generation of foreign-function bindings.

- The scribble/acmart language uses v2.01, which avoids errors
  concerning the hyperref package in some latex installations.
