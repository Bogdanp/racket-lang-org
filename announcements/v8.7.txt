Racket v8.7

Racket version 8.7 is now available from

    https://racket-lang.org/

As of this release:

* Typed Racket offers Shallow and Optional modes for its gradual
  types. These modes lower the cost of interacting with untyped code,
  but provide less protection against buggy interactions.
  (see https://docs.racket-lang.org/ts-reference/behavior-of-types.html )

* Racket uses Unicode 14.0 for character and string operations, and
  includes grapheme operations. DrRacket supports emojis.
  (see https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/editor-overview.html#%28part._graphemes%29 )

* Racket supports RV64G (RISC-V).

* Programmers can disable definition shadowing using
  `(#%declare #:require=define)`.
  (see https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/module.html#%28form._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._~23~25declare%29%29 )

* The module dependency graphs available using raco dependencies-graph
  and DrRacket's Module browser are faster and have new package
  filtering support.
  (see https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/module-browser.html#%28idx._%28gentag._39._%28lib._scribblings%2Fdrracket%2Fdrracket..scrbl%29%29%29 )

* DrRacket is more responsive when killing programs that produce a lot
  of output.

* Plot 3D allows negative altitude values (e.g., looking at the plot
  from "below").
  (see https://docs.racket-lang.org/plot/plotting.html#%28def._%28%28lib._plot%2Fmain..rkt%29._plot3d%29%29 )

* The `scriblib/bibtex` and `scriblib/autobib` libraries support DOIs.
  (see https://docs.racket-lang.org/scriblib/autobib.html#%28def._%28%28lib._scriblib%2Fautobib..rkt%29._make-bib%29%29 )

* There are many other repairs and improvements!
