Racket v8.6

Racket version 8.6 is now available from

    https://racket-lang.org/

As of this release:

* Racket has an "equal-always?" primitive that equates values that will stay
  the same even if mutated. See
  https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/Equality.html#%28def._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._equal-always~3f%29%29

* This release uses a new build system, Zuo, which is implemented as a
  little language, in accordance with the ideas of Language Oriented
  Programming (LOP). The implementation has a single C file (plus libraries
  implemented in Zuo), so it compiles easily. The `zuo/build`
  library is modeled on `make` and Shake for tracking dependencies and
  build steps. See https://docs.racket-lang.org/zuo/index.html and
  https://racket.discourse.group/t/new-build-system-pushed-to-git-repo/873

* Racket supports stencil vectors, which associate a virtual bitmask
  with a vector, enabling certain mask-equipped update operations. See
  https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/stencil_vectors.html

* Racket supports Arm64 machines running Windows.

* Redex has support for simultaneous substitutions. See
  https://docs.racket-lang.org/redex/reference.html#%28form._%28%28lib._redex%2Freduction-semantics..rkt%29._substitute%29%29

* The Web Server provides control over the maximum number of
  concurrent connections via its "safety limits" construct. See
  https://docs.racket-lang.org/web-server-internal/dispatch-server-unit.html#%28part._safety-limits%29

* The Web Server has improved logging performance and improved
  request parsing performance, reducing tail latencies.

* The Web Server supports logging response status code via
  web-server/dispatchers/dispatch-logresp. See
  https://docs.racket-lang.org/web-server-internal/dispatch-logresp.html

* The `db` library supports custom types for PostgreSQL connections; see
  `pg-custom-type` for details. See
  https://docs.racket-lang.org/db/util.html#%28def._%28%28lib._db%2Futil%2Fpostgresql..rkt%29._pg-custom-type%29%29

* The release includes many other repairs and changes!
