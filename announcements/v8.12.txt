Racket v8.12

----------------------------------------------------------------------

As of this release:

- The "Die Macht der Abstraktion" language levels are no longer present,
replaced by the "Schreibe dein Programm" language levels which have been
available for several years. (see https://www.deinprogramm.de/sdp/ )

- The release fixes a problem with the binding structure of the `for/fold`
form in the rare situation when an iteration clause identifier shadowed
an accumulator identifier. This change may break code that depends on
the old binding structure. (see https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/for.html#%28form._%28%28lib._racket%2Fprivate%2Fbase..rkt%29._for%2Ffold%29%29 )

- Racket automatically sets the close-on-exec flag when opening a file, on
systems where this is available. This change lowers the cost of avoiding
problems that can occur when file descriptors become accidentally shared
between processes. (see https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/file-ports.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Fprivate%2Fbase..rkt%29._open-input-file%29%29 )

- Match includes `hash` and `hash*` patterns. (see https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/match.html#%28form._%28%28lib._racket%2Fmatch..rkt%29._match%29%29 )

- The `vector-set/copy` function allows creation of a new vector that differs
at only one index. This change also adds `vector-append` and `vector-copy`
primitives. (see https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/vectors.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Fvector..rkt%29._vector-set%2Fcopy%29%29 )

- The `pregexp-quote` function brings the functionality of `regexp-quote`
to pregexps. (see https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/regexp.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Fprivate%2Fbase..rkt%29._pregexp-quote%29%29 )

- The C FFI convention-based converter supports `PascalCase` and `camelCase` in
addition to an underscore-based convention. (see https://docs.racket-lang.org/foreign/Defining_Bindings.html#%28form._%28%28lib._ffi%2Funsafe%2Fdefine%2Fconventions..rkt%29._convention~3ahyphen-~3ecamel.Case%29%29 )

- The `racket/case` library allows `case`-like forms that use different
equality comparisons, such as `eq?` and `equal-always?`. (see https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/case.html#%28form._%28%28lib._racket%2Fcase..rkt%29._case%2Fequal%29%29 )

- Scribble rendering to HTML adds linking and information buttons when
hovering over heading titles.

- The `interval-map` data structure supports iterator functions in the style
of `gen:ordered-dict`. (see https://docs.racket-lang.org/data/Orders_and_Ordered_Dictionaries.html#%28def._%28%28lib._data%2Forder..rkt%29._gen~3aordered-dict%29%29 )
